# OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect is an identity module on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing clients to verify the identity of end-users based on the authentication performed by an authorization server. It also provides basic user profile information.

## Key Features
* Authentication: Ensures secure user authentication and authorization.
* Single Sign-On (SSO): Allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications.
* User Information: Provides access to user profile information.
* Interoperability: Works with various identity providers like Google, Microsoft, and others.
* Security: Implements robust security measures to protect user data.

## Configuration
The module configuration for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication is defined in the appsettings.json file under the `oidc` section. This configuration enables the application to authenticate users using the OIDC protocol. Below are the parameters and their descriptions:

* Enabled: A boolean value indicating whether OIDC authentication is enabled. Set to true to enable.
* AuthenticationType: Specifies the type of authentication. For OIDC, this should be set to "oidc".
* Authority: The URL of the OIDC provider. This is the base address of the identity provider, e.g., https://localhost:5001.
* AuthenticationCaption: A user-friendly name for the authentication method, e.g., "OpenID Connect".
* ApplicationId: The unique identifier for the application registered with the OIDC provider.
* ClientId: The client identifier issued to the application by the OIDC provider.
* ClientSecret: The client secret issued to the application by the OIDC provider. This should be kept confidential.
* DefaultUserType: Specifies the default user type upon successful authentication, e.g., "Manager".
* ResponseMode: Defines how the authorization response is returned. Common values are "query" or "fragment".
* ResponseType: Specifies the type of response expected from the OIDC provider. For example, "code" for authorization code flow.
* RequireHttpsMetadata: A boolean value indicating whether HTTPS metadata is required. Set to false for development environments.
* SaveTokens: A boolean value indicating whether to save the tokens received from the OIDC provider.
* UseTokenLifetime: A boolean value indicating whether to use the tokenâ€™s lifetime as provided by the OIDC provider.
* Scope: An array of strings specifying the scopes requested from the OIDC provider, e.g., ["profile", "email"].
* GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint: A boolean value indicating whether to retrieve additional claims from the user info endpoint.
* CallbackPath: The path to which the OIDC provider will redirect after authentication, by default "/signin-openid-connect"

> Note: If you other external sign-in providers installed (Microsoft Entra ID or Google SSO) you need to make sure to use unique callback paths for each provider.
